In terminal use the command "uvicorn main:app --reload" to load up the application.

The HTTP endpoints are listed in http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs 

Refer to docstrings and typehints if you have questions regarding certain functionality.

To run the project first include a .env in config folder with the following parameters:

DATABASE_HOSTNAME
DATABASE_PORT
DATABASE_PASSWORD
DATABASE_NAME
DATABASE_USERNAME 
SECRET_KEY
ALGORITHM= eg. "HS256"
ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRE_MINUTES="enter integer for minutes"

Navigate to the root folder and create a file named `mariadb.env`. This file will hold environment variables specific to your MariaDB container setup:
- `MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD`: The password for the root user of your MariaDB instance. Ensure this is a strong, unique password.
- `MYSQL_DATABASE`: The name of the database that MariaDB will initially create upon container startup. This should ideally match the `DATABASE_NAME` from the `.env` file in the `backend/config` directory.

When you provide an authorization token go to the authorisation tab in postman and there you should select bearer token, enclosed in quotation marks.
